Senior, hands-on support for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## Focus

As AI accelerates development, many failures now come from solving the wrong problem convincingly. I focus on validating domain correctness, data ownership, and test relevance in AI-assisted codebases where failure tolerance is low—and where systems can appear correct while producing the wrong outcomes.

## What I Do

- Business Central development and extension work  
- NAV to Business Central migrations (on-premises and SaaS)  
- Architecture and integration design  
- CI/CD pipeline automation and hardening  
- Test automation and testing standards  
- Break/fix troubleshooting and escalation support  
- Code review, logic interrogation, and domain-level validation for AI-assisted development  

## How I Add Value

- Identify mismatches between acceptance criteria and the actual Business Central data model  
- Detect spurious or misleading tests that validate implementation details instead of business outcomes  
- Diagnose systems that pass builds and tests but violate domain or financial invariants due to misframed assumptions  
- Reduce rework and downstream risk by catching domain errors before they ship behind apparent correctness  
- Provide senior technical oversight in environments with accelerated, AI-assisted delivery  
- Investigate non-linear failure modes by reconstructing procedural causality and business constraints when symptoms and causes are decoupled

## Engagement Models

- Fixed-scope quoted work  
- Time-boxed blocks of hours  
- Monthly retainer for review, validation, and escalation support  
- Time and materials (T&M)
