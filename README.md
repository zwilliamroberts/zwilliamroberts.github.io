# Technical Capacity Partner for Business Central MSPs

**White-Label Development \| Complex Migrations \| Integration Expertise**

## The Challenge

Your BC practice is growing, but specialized technical work keeps creating bottlenecks:

- Complex multi-entity consolidations tying up senior developers for months
- Legacy system migrations requiring deep data migration expertise  
- Custom integration projects too specialized to staff full-time
- Emergency escalations when clients need database-level troubleshooting

## What I Provide

Specialized Business Central technical capacity on a white-label or subcontractor basis—the expertise you need without hiring overhead.

### Complex Migration Work

- Entry number conflict resolution across acquired entities  
- Legacy ERP migrations from any OLAP or ODBC data source to Business Central (NAV, GP, custom systems, homegrown ERPs)
- Custom migration tooling reducing typical timelines by 50-75%

### Integration & Development

- Custom API development (AL, .NET, C#)
- Azure Functions and middleware architecture
- Third-party system integrations
- AppSource application development

### Technical Problem Solving

- Performance troubleshooting and database optimization
- Break/fix escalations for complex technical issues
- CI/CD pipeline implementation (GitHub Actions, AL-Go)
- Code review and architecture validation
